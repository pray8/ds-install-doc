# Interactions in OpsCenter

The **Interactions** section provides insights into the created data pipes, their flows, and the requests and responses each node processes. At a higher level, it offers a visualization of how each data pipe functions. This is one of the key features of OpsCenter.

Additionally, the Interactions section helps in analyzing API calls, providing details on whether they were successful or encountered errors.

The **Total Interactions** metric defines the number of times a particular API has been invoked. The UI also offers various filtering options to view records based on status — such as **Success**, **Pending**, or **Error**.

## Detailed View of Interaction Records

Each record in this documentation provides detailed insights into individual nodes within the data pipeline. Each entry includes the following key sections:

- **Overview**:  
  A high-level summary of the node’s execution status. It shows whether the node encountered an error or was executed successfully.

- **Input Data**:  
  The data received by the node before processing.

- **Output Data**:  
  The data generated by the node after execution.

By referring to the **Overview**, users can quickly determine if a node executed successfully or ran into issues. The **Input Data** and **Output Data** sections offer a comprehensive understanding of the data flow at each stage of the pipeline.

The above details clearly indicate that the API has been invoked, showing:

- **Start Time**
- **End Time**
- **Request Duration**
- **Status**

### Input and Output by Node Type

For instance:

- **HTTP Server Node**  
  Input data includes the HTTP method, path, unique transaction ID, and whether authentication is enabled.

- **Codeblock Node**  
  Input data consists of variables or payloads passed to the node.  
  Output data contains the response generated by the execution logic in the code block.
