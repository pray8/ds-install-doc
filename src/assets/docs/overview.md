<!-- # Platform Overview

## Introduction

Our product **“datanimbus.io”** aka **DNIO** is an **IPaaS** platform.  
The idea is to help customers solve their integration problem and also to help our existing products integrate with the customer systems.  

It’s a **single and secured data management platform** that helps an enterprise **organize, analyze, integrate, distribute, govern, and deploy data**, enabling the highest possible security features.  

We have two ways to access our product: **Studio** and **OpsCenter**.  
Customers can use these two portals to manage and manipulate the data they are dealing with.  

- **Studio / Author**: This portal is used by users for defining the data structure and building Flows.  
- **OpsCenter / AppCenter**: This is where the CRUD operations are performed on the data along with the audits.  

These portals can be accessed by users that are created from **Studio/Author**.  
The guide for creating and managing users, bots, and groups can be accessed here:

**Flows** are another name for **Data Pipes**. This page provides examples on:  
- How to create flows  
- The components and their functionality  
- What exactly a flow does  
- Execution and management of flows

# Platform Overview

## Introduction

**datanimbus.io (DNIO)** is a secure, enterprise-grade **Integration Platform as a Service (IPaaS)** built to simplify system integration and data operations. It enables organizations to **organize, analyze, integrate, distribute, govern, and deploy data** — all from a single platform, with industry-standard security at its core.

DNIO offers two access points:
- **Studio (Author)** – used to define data structures and build data Flows (also called Data Pipes)
- **OpsCenter (AppCenter)** – used to perform CRUD operations, manage data, and view audits

---

## Studio (Author)

**Studio**, also referred to as **Author**, is the developer portal of DNIO. It serves as the workspace for designing and managing the core data and integration logic that powers the platform. Studio is where developers define how data should be structured, processed, and exposed — forming the foundation for all integrations within the DNIO ecosystem.

---

## OpsCenter (AppCenter)

**OpsCenter**, also known as **AppCenter**, is the operational interface for business users and data operators. It provides a centralized space to interact with data — allowing users to create, read, update, and delete records, view audit logs, and monitor system activity in real time. OpsCenter bridges the gap between data modeling and day-to-day operations.

---

## Key Capabilities

- Create **data Tables** with full **CRUD API support** — instantly, with no code  
- Build and manage **Flows (Data Pipes)** to automate data operations across systems  
- Execute and monitor data pipelines with complete visibility and control  

DNIO runs securely in enterprise environments and is built to scale with your data integration needs.
