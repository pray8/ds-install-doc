# Platform Overview

## Introduction

Our product **“datanimbus.io”** aka **DNIO** is an **IPaaS** platform.  
The idea is to help customers solve their integration problem and also to help our existing products integrate with the customer systems.  

It’s a **single and secured data management platform** that helps an enterprise **organize, analyze, integrate, distribute, govern, and deploy data**, enabling the highest possible security features.  

We have two ways to access our product: **Studio** and **OpsCenter**.  
Customers can use these two portals to manage and manipulate the data they are dealing with.  

- **Studio / Author**: This portal is used by users for defining the data structure and building Flows.  
- **OpsCenter / AppCenter**: This is where the CRUD operations are performed on the data along with the audits.  

These portals can be accessed by users that are created from **Studio/Author**.  
The guide for creating and managing users, bots, and groups can be accessed here:
