# Deployments

### Introduction

The Deployment feature enables users to manage, configure, and monitor deployments, ensuring seamless integration with associated datapipes, plugins, formats, services, and agents. It provides a structured interface for deployment tracking, modification, and synchronization while maintaining operational efficiency.

### Problems that Deployment feature solved

Users can create multiple flows as needed, but as the project scales, managing them becomes challenging, and infrastructure costs increase. DNIO operates with seven core modules, each generating a pod in Kubernetes (k8s). Additionally, every data service and flow creates its own pod, meaning the total number of pods generated by the platform follows the formula: (7 + NDS + NDP).

To improve readability and efficiency, Deployments enable users to group multiple datapipes, offering a structured approach to management. Additionally, deployments provide the option to consolidate multiple flows into a single k8s pod, reducing the overall pod count and optimizing resource usage.

### Steps to create a Deployment

    ● Login to Author portal and click on the Deployments feature under Management tab, this will
     show us a list of already existing deployments.

    ● Click on New, enter the desired name for your deployment, and choose the Datapipes you want to
     include (highlighted in red). Once selected, click Save Changes to finalize the deployment.

    ● After creating the deployment, you will be directed to the following screen. Please refer to 
    the deployment details section for explanations of each terminology.

Deployment Details

    Each deployment consists of:

        ● Deployment Name: Unique identifier (dg-agdemo in this case).

        ● Namespace: Associated system space (appveen-amithkashyap).

        ● Status: Indicates whether the deployment is active, running, or stopped.

Users can interact with various configuration tabs, allowing a deeper insight into the components linked to a given deployment.

Sub-Tabs Under Deployment

The Deployment Dashboard consists of multiple tabs that allow administrators to configure and monitor different elements associated with the deployment.

1. Flows

    The Flows tab displays the datapipes attached to the deployment, showcasing execution details, invocation history, and connection pathways.

        ● Example Flows in AgDemo:

            ◦ xlsxToCsv – Handles data transformation from Excel to CSV.

            ◦ AgentsDemo – A workflow triggered via an agent.

2. Plugins

    The Plugins tab shows the plugins used within the attached datapipes.

    Ensures extension compatibility for enhanced functionality.

    Helps in managing dependencies required for specific data operations.

3. Connections

    The Connections tab provides visibility into the external connections linked to the attached datapipes.

    Displays integrations with other services.

    Shows how data flows between deployments and external platforms.

4. Formats

    The Formats tab details the data formats used in datapipes within the deployment.

    Ensures proper formatting for data transactions.

    Helps in maintaining consistency in data processing and transformation.

5. Services

    This tab provides insights into the core services associated with the deployment.

    Allows service-specific configurations.

    Helps users debug and optimize underlying microservices.

6. Agents

    The Agents tab showcases which agents are used within the attached datapipes.

    Ensures that system automation is properly configured.

    Provides a breakdown of agent dependencies and runtime properties.

Deployment Management Actions

Highlighted in Red (Action Buttons)

Users have multiple management options to configure their deployments:

    ● Edit: Modify deployment settings.

    ● Delete: Remove deployment if necessary.

    ● YAML: View and modify the YAML file associated with this deployment.

    ● Sync: Any changes made to the deployment require synchronization for updates to take effect.

    ● Stop: Halt the deployment when necessary.

#### Conclusion

The Deployment feature allows users to efficiently manage, monitor, and modify their deployments while ensuring integration with connected datapipes, plugins, connections, formats, services, and agents. By leveraging structured sub-tabs and management actions, users can optimize deployment performance while maintaining system reliability and provide the option to consolidate multiple flows into a single k8s pod, reducing the overall pod count and optimizing resource usage.
